I became interested in a relativly unexplored technology which could carry cargo into low earth orbit extremely efficienty with zero energy. This program calculates the physical characteristics of a vacuum chamber and the bouyency effects it experiences when submerged in air at sea level.

# vacuum-lift-calculator
Terminal script which calculates the effective negative mass due to buoyancy effects of a vacuum chamber for a given material density, wall thickness, material cost and volume.
