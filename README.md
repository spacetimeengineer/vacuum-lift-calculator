Vacuum Chamber Buoyency Calculator
==================================

![alt text](https://github.com/spacetimeengineer/vacuum-lift-calculator/blob/master/vacuum-lift-image.png)

A python script which calculates the effective negative mass due to buoyancy effects of a vacuum chamber for a given material density, wall thickness, material cost and volume.

I became interested in a somewhat unexplored technology which could replace the need for a space elevator and eliminate a majority of the costs and timeframes required. As it turns out, if one captures a large volume of vacuum one could achieve 1.27 kilograms per cubic meter at sea level of effective negative mass! In otherwords, a significantly heavy or rigid mass may free float in the air by balancing the force of gravity with the forces due to bouyency. In addition this force is about seven times that of bouyent forces due to helium.

This program calculates the physical characteristics of a vacuum chamber and the bouyency effects it experiences when submerged in air at sea level.

To run just navigate to the script directory and enter:

    $ python3 vacuum-lift-calculator.py
